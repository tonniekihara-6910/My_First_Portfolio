    <h3>My Journey</h3>

    <!-- Paragraphs -->
    <p>
        This is my very first portfolio webpage created using only basic HTML. 
        It is a small but important step in my web development journey.
    </p>
    <p>
        I enjoy learning new things, especially when it comes to technology 
        and building creative digital experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
        Through this journey, I hope to improve my skills and become a better 
        developer with each project I complete.
    </p>
    <p>
        Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I hope this page shows my progress 
        and commitment to learning web development.
    </p>
