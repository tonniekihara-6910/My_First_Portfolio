    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is my very first webpage, created to practice HTML basics. It contains multiple elements that make it valid and structured.</p>

    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>This webpage shows how to use headings, paragraphs, and images in HTML. It is simple but follows the proper standards of web development.</p>

    <h3>What You Will Find Here</h3>
    <p>You will see at least four paragraphs, a heading of each level (h1, h2, h3), and a clickable image that links to another website.</p>

    <p>Creating web pages step by step helps me understand the structure of HTML and prepares me to build more advanced websites later on.</p>
