    <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
    <p>This is my very first webpage built with basic HTML. I'm excited to explore how web development works and start creating cool projects.</p>

    <!-- Sub heading -->
    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>This page contains headings, paragraphs, and even a clickable image! It's part of my learning journey in HTML basics.</p>

    <!-- Another heading -->
    <h3>Why Iâ€™m Learning HTML</h3>
    <p>Learning HTML is the first step to understanding how the web works. It helps me structure webpages, and later I can style them with CSS and add interactivity with JavaScript.</p>

    <!-- Extra paragraph -->
    <p>Practice makes perfect. The more I code, the more confident I become. This is just the beginning of something greater!</p>
